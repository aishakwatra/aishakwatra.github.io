    "longDescription": "This 3D racing simulation was a third-year OpenGL project focused on implementing advanced graphics and physics systems from the ground up. The project features a complete Physically Based Rendering (PBR) pipeline for realistic, physically-grounded materials and lighting, all set within a 3D skybox. A core technical component is the optimized collision engine, which uses a spatial grid to accelerate queries. This allows for real-time suspension physics (via ray-triangle intersection queries) and accurate track collisions (via AABB checks). The demo is complete with vehicle physics, a flexible follow-cam, 3D model loading via Assimp, and a full UI with a lap timer.",
